I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Statistics Department](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/)! I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io) and [Prof. Mahdi Cheraghchi](https://mahdi.cheraghchi.info/). Previously, I completed my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and [Chemical Engineering](https://che.engin.umich.edu/) also at UM. 

My reseach interests are broadly in anything Machine Learning Theory (MLT) related. Some specific areas of interest include: Online Learning, Bandits, Boosting, Differential Privacy, and Algorithmic Fairness. Right now, I am really excited about the intersection of Learning Theory and Differential Privacy. In addition to MLT, I am interested in adjacent areas such as Combinatorial Optimization and Adaptive Data Analysis. In general, I like to work on theoretical problems with some tangible implications to society. 

Fun fact: you can find a picture of me on UM's [Chemical Engineering](https://che.engin.umich.edu/) page!
