I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Statistics Department](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) advised by [Prof. Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io). Previously, I completed my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and [Chemical Engineering](https://che.engin.umich.edu/) also at UM where I worked with [Prof. Mahdi Cheraghchi](https://mahdi.cheraghchi.info), [Dr. Sindhu Kutty](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~skutty/), and [Prof. Andrej Lenert](https://lenert.engin.umich.edu).  

My reseach interests are broadly anything in Machine Learning Theory (MLT). Some specific areas of interest include: Online Learning, Boosting, Bandits, Differential Privacy, and Algorithmic Fairness. Right now, I am really excited about the intersection of Learning Theory and Differential Privacy. In addition to MLT, I am also interested in algorithm research, specifically topics like streaming and combinatorial optimization. In general, I like to work on theoretical problems that have some practical importance. 

I am grateful to be supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP) from Fall 2023. Feel free to shoot me an email if youâ€™d like me to review your GRFP application!
